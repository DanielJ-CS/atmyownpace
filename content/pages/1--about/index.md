A couple of notes before I start off this website. This website is and will never be intended to tell you the right way of coding or doing these coding questions. I am as inexperienced as many of the people getting out of university. Instead, it will be a record of my progress throughout doing multiple coding questions. 

##<em>Why did I create this website? </em>

I created this website for a couple of reasons. One reason is that I find that working on a project that is seen by people(even if noone actually sees this) motivates me to work harder to present a satisfactory final product. Also, I want to record the progress as I do more and more coding related things and, maybe in five or ten years, I can look back at where I first began and observe my growth.

Another reason is that I wanted to create a deploy and website. For this project, I decided to work in React. So I ended up using GatsbyJS and created this website off one of Gatsby's starter templates, created by Greg Lobinski. 

Lastly, I would like to say that throughout the entirety of this project, I hope to become a better coder in a general sense. I know that much of what I will do in the beginning is not the most efficient way of doing some of the questions but I believe that, in time, I will develop my understanding of many programming concepts.
